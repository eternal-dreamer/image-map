        <p>Harry Potter is the hero of the story. Orphaned as a baby, he is brought up by his aunt and uncle, the
            Dursleys, maltreated by them, and tormented by their obnoxious son, Dudley. Neglected and disdained, Harry
            grows up to be a timid boy unsure of his abilities. His sudden fame as a wizard at Hogwarts comes not just
            as a total contrast to his earlier forgotten misery, but as a fate that we feel is very much deserved after
            his youthful suffering. Yet even after he becomes famous, Harry never loses his modesty and humility.</p>
